This plugin provides scanning functions for the FM-DX web server.

Important notes: 

For ESP32 (e.g. TEF6686) receivers, the plugin uses the newly integrated scan function. However, the prerequisite is the latest firmware version (RC version). In addition to scanning control using the additional left/right buttons, the scanning sensitivity can be adjusted in the receiver's menu. In addition, the receiver's integrated auto scan mode can be started and stopped via the web interface.  If you don't have a suitable firmware version running on your ESP32 receiver or use a receiver of a different type, you can use the plugin's scan mode using a switch (true/false) in the plugin's source code. However, Auto Scan is not available in this operating mode.

### version v1.0a:
- Direct use of the integrated scan function of the ESP32 receiver (PE5PVB ESP32 firmware required!)
